    <!-- Add terms here! -->
    <div>
        <h2 mat-dialog-title>1. Scope</h2>
        <p>
            (1) These Terms and Conditions apply to all contracts with Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba in relation to the Canadian Collection of Agricultural Soil Microbes [CCASM], in particular for deposits and orders of microbial strains, and for all services and the identification of bacteria by CCASM for its customers, unless deviations are expressly agreed in the individual contract for a particular case.
            <br><br>
            (2) A prerequisite for the establishment of a contract is that the customer is a legal person under civil or public law, or a special fund under public law, and that the customer’s business relationship with Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba is part of the customer’s commercial or independent activity.
            <br><br>
            (3) These general business terms and conditions also apply to all future business relationships even if this is not expressly agreed upon separately. We hereby exclude in advance the inclusion of general business terms and conditions of a customer that conflict with or amend our general business terms and conditions.
            <br><br>
            (4) The term “biological material” as it is used in the following is synonymous with the “genetic resource (GR)” of Directive (EU) No. 511/2014. The term “product” is used in the product catalogue. This is also synonymous. Biological material means CCASM original material along with its progeny and unmodified derivatives including unmodified derivatives existing within modifications. Un-modified derivatives are substances created by the Recipient which constitute an unmodified sub-unit or function of the biological material.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>2. Contract Definition</h2>
        <p>
            (1) Our product catalogue including the prices is non-binding and subject to change without notice.
            <br><br>
            (2) By submitting an order the customer makes a binding offer to buy that can be accepted by Queen’s University or the University of Manitoba within 14 days. The terms of timing for patent deposits are established by the Budapest Treaty.
            <br><br>
            (3) After an offer to buy is received via the online shop, the customer will receive an e-mail from the CCASM curators confirming that the order has been received and asking for additional details. This confirmation of receipt does not constitute acceptance. A contract is not concluded with the confirmation of receipt.
            <br><br>
            (4) Acceptance of the offer by Queen’s University or the University of Manitoba is by means of an express written statement or in text form, or by means of actual delivery or performance of a service. Written acceptance of an order is considered in due time if it takes place within 14 days and is coincident with issuing of the invoice.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>3. Transportation</h2>
        <p>
            (1) Delivery and services are CPT (Incoterms 2020). With the transfer of the biological material to the freight carrier, the risk of accidental deterioration and accidental loss passes to the customer.
            <br><br>
            (2) Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba handles packaging and transportation at the customer’s expense unless otherwise agreed. The mode of dispatch and route are chosen by Queen’s University or the University of Manitoba unless otherwise agreed.

            <br>
        </p>

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>4. Delivery date</h2>
        <p>
            The delivery dates provided in the order confirmation are not binding for Queen’s University or the University of Manitoba. All delivery commitments and services are adapted to the behaviour of the biological material, subject to the condition of adequate and timely supply to Queen’s University or the University of Manitoba, and the finding at the discretion of Queen’s University or the University of Manitoba that the delivery is usable and otherwise permitted.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>5. Delivery terms and conditions</h2>
        <p>
            (1) With the establishment of the contract, the customer assumes responsibility for the proper and legally compliant handling of the biological material. The customer must ensure that the biological material received is processed by adequately trained qualified personnel and in an adequate laboratory environment.
            <br><br>
            (2) The customer affirms familiarity with all relevant biological, microbiological, chemical, and/or radioactive safety standards as well as the specific practices, equipment, facilities, and regulations.
            <br><br>
            (3) Deliveries and services are subject to various national and international provisions, in particular infection protection law, genetic engineering law, and arms control law. The customer is required to inform himself of the provisions of the above-mentioned laws as well as any recent or relevant updates to these laws. The customer assumes sole responsibility for compliance with the applicable laws. Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba assume no liability for legal violations or breaches of duty by the customer. Inquiring about current national regulations such as import restrictions is also the responsibility of the customer. If import documents are required, the customer is obligated to provide these to Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba unsolicited and in a timely manner.
            <br><br>
            (4) If an official permit is required, delivery takes place only after submission of the same. The biological Risk Group is published (but not legally binding) in the current catalogue on the CCASM website and in the product identification. In any case, Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba recommends handling the product according to methods for containment level 2.

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>8. Product quality</h2>
        <p>
            (1) The customer is aware that the characteristics of the biological material are such that it is provided solely for immediate use. A reclamation must therefore be made within five working days.
            <br><br>
            (2) The customer is also aware that the services and products involve biological materials. These can have hazardous characteristics and may be subject to quality fluctuations that are beyond the control of Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba.
            <br><br>
            (3) The high quality standards of Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba support the availability of pure, viable, and authentic biological material. All quality guarantees require an express written declaration. Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba do not guarantee the shelf life or durability of the products and services in any way.

            <br><br>
            (3) When other damages are based on simple negligence, the liability of Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba for the violation of an essential obligation (cardinal obligation) is limited to the damages typical for the contract that were reasonably foreseeable at the time the respective contract was concluded and routinely correspond to the purchase price of the biological material.
            <br><br>
            (4) Any further liability, especially for damages due to improper use of the goods or for damages due to force majeure, is excluded; liability for malice and/or based on guarantees remains unaffected.
            <br><br>
            (5) Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba assume no responsibility for the loss of viability of the biological material due to irradiation, other adverse effects during transportation or delays. Consulting with the customs or postal authorities of the respective transit and destination countries in case of impending adverse events is the responsibility of the customer.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>10. Scope of use/contract penalty</h2>
        <p>
            (1) The customer pledges to accept the restrictions on permitted use from the country of origin listed in the catalogue under “Restrictions” (see also Section 6). The customer pledges to pay a contract penalty in case of intentional, culpable infringement. The contract penalty as with commercial use (Paragraph 4) is CAD 1,000. Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba has the right to assert possible additional claims for damages. In this case the contract penalty is offset against the asserted claim for damages. The customer has the right to provide proof that no violation has occurred.
            <br><br>
            (2) The use of the products is limited solely to the facilities of the customer and enterprises to which they are affiliated. The customer is the end user. Transfer to third parties is prohibited, except for legitimate exchange pursuant to Section 3. "Third Parties" are companies not affiliated with the customer. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis require the written consent of Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba and, where applicable, the written consent to all third-party terms of use. Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba assume no liability for transfers to third parties. The customer obligates itself to pay a contract penalty in case of intentional, culpable transfer to third parties. The contract penalty as with commercial use (Paragraph 4) is CAD 1,000. Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba has the right to assert possible additional claims for damages. In this case the contract penalty is offset against the asserted claim for damages. The customer has the right to provide proof that no violation has occurred.
            <br><br>
            (3) Unless excluded by a supplemental, depositor-provided Material Transfer Agreement (MTA; see Section 6) to the contrary, the transfer of microorganisms and cell cultures within the scope of a legitimate exchange as defined in the ECCO core MTA is permitted. This refers to the transfer of material between scientists at the same laboratory or between researchers working on a non-commercial joint project at various institutes. The partner may only use the material for the non-commercial joint project. The partner is obliged to comply with these General Terms and Conditions in the same way as the original customer. The legitimate exchange also includes the exchange of material between public collections (BRCs) for the purpose of depositing. The transfer of material to a receiving public collection/BRC requires that the collection has similar conditions to those of CCASM.
            <br><br>
            (4) Any commercial use of the material is excluded without prior written consent of Queen’s University or the University of Manitoba. Commercial use of products that are not regulated by the Nagoya Protocol is when the products are used directly for the purpose of profit generation or for a patent application. Internal use for quality control and as reference material is not a commercial use, unless the tests are performed for product approval and listed accordingly in reports for approval. For orders of microorganisms, commercial use is possible on a case-by-case basis with the consent of CCASM management. For material regulated by the Nagoya Protocol, the customer is required to adhere to the conditions in the (PIC/MAT) document associated with the material. See paragraphs 1 and 6 of this section for related restrictions and fines. The customer obligates itself to pay a contract penalty in case of intentional culpable or unapproved commercial use. The contract penalty is CAD 1,000 corresponding to the full cost price of own isolation. written consent of Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba has the right to assert possible additional claims for damages. In this case the contract penalty is offset against the asserted claim for damages. The customer has the right to provide proof that no violation has occurred.
            <br><br>
            (5) If the customer publishes research results, the publication of the original investigator and collection number (CCASM number) and CCASM as the supplier also have to be included.
            <br><br>
            (6) Prior Informed Consent (PIC), Mutually Agreed Terms (MAT), Internationally Recognised Certificate of Compliance (IRCC) and/or an additional (depositor-originated) Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) may exist for specific products. Where applicable, the corresponding files will be provided to the customer before an agreement to purchase a microorganism is finalized (Section "Nagoya Protocol Restrictions"). The customer pledges to save these documents, adhere to the provisions defined therein, and to retain the documents for 20 years after they are last used. If there are subsequent users on a case-by-case basis (see Section 2), the documents must be transferred to them by the customer in full.
            <br><br>
            (7) A general check by Queen’s University or the University of Manitoba of third-party rights does not take place. In case of known third-party rights, the customer may only use the product after agreement to those rights imposed by the third party. The corresponding documents will be either available in the catalog or sent to the customer by CCASM. In these cases the customer can cancel their order within two weeks.
            <br><br>
            (8) All biological material from CCASM is intended solely for research purposes and is not for use in humans (including food or cosmetics) or for veterinary or clinical purposes.
            <br><br>

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>12. Deposits</h2>
        <p>
            (1) Unless otherwise agreed, the depositor of biological material agrees that the material can be deposited in the public collection.
            <br><br>
            (2) If no agreements to the contrary have been established, Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba is permitted to disseminate the biological material to customers without notifying the depositor.
            <br><br>
            (3) Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba reserve the right to add biological material deposited for the purpose of publication to the public catalogue after two years even if no publication has taken place.
            <br><br>
            (4) The depositor affirms that the information provided at the time of depositing, in particular the CBD or Nagoya-related information (such as the collection location and date as well as the submitted documents and documentation such as Prior Informed Consent [PIC] and Mutually Agreed Terms [MAT] or Internationally Recognised Certificate of Compliance [IRCC] and Material Transfer Agreement [MTA]), is truthful and was provided in all conscience. Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba reserve the right to assert claims for damages against the depositor in case of wilfully incorrect information.
            <br><br>
            (5) The documents submitted to CCASM with the biological material for the public collection (PIC, MAT or IRCC and MTA) will be made available to customers. The collection location and date may also be published in the catalogue.            
            <br><br>
            (6) Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba reserve the right to sequence, publish, and make publicly available the genomes of any micro-organism deposited into CCASM if no genome sequence is publicly available within two years of deposit into CCASM.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>13. Amendments and modifications</h2>
        <p>
            (1) Queen’s University and the University of Manitoba reserve the right to stop the availability of products without prior notice or to adapt their delivery terms.
            <br><br>
            (2) When biological material is ordered with the specification of a non-CCASM culture collection number, CCASM will deliver the corresponding culture according to the strain history of the organism with a CCASM-numbered product.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h2 mat-dialog-title>14. Choice of law and jurisdiction</h2>
